# How to pay for the Arduino Create Chrome app

Arduino create Chromebook service partitions into two segments i.e for the single user or under the school education plan.

1. For a **single user**: you can pay via chrome web store using this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arduino-create/dcgicpihgkmccjigalccipmjlnjopdfe). The chrome web store app for Arduino is free for 30 days and the monthly payment for using the chrome app subscription is 0.99 USD.

2. For the **school education plan**: The subscription plans for the Arduino Create chrome app are divided into 3 main different categories based on the number of seats. So the price of the seat goes down if you buy more seats.  Please make sure that the email for purchasing the subscriptions for the education plan must be a google account.
   Take into account that you can create multiple groups or classrooms within the same subscription. Suppose, you bought 300 seats, then you can create 3 classrooms for 5th grade, 6th grade and 7th-grade students.  
   
   Please have a look at this link of our [Digital Store page](https://create.arduino.cc/plans/chrome-app) on the official Arduino [website](https://www.arduino.cc/) where you will be able to see the pricing of each seat based on the size of your classroom.
